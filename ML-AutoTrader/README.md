ML-AutoTrader is a sophisticated research platform that leverages cutting-edge machine learning techniques for predictive modeling and automated trading in financial markets. This project implements a comprehensive suite of prediction models and trading strategies, combining traditional technical analysis with advanced machine learning algorithms.

### Key Features

- **Data Acquisition**: Robust integration with yfinance for efficient retrieval of historical stock data.
- **Advanced Data Processing**: Comprehensive feature engineering pipeline, including technical indicators and derived financial metrics.
- **Multi-Model Approach**: Implementation of state-of-the-art machine learning models:
  - Random Forest for ensemble-based predictions
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence modeling
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM) for high-dimensional space mapping
  - XGBoost for gradient boosting
- **Traditional Strategies**: Incorporation of time-tested technical indicator-based trading strategies.
- **Backtesting Engine**: Rigorous historical performance evaluation of various strategies.
- **Risk Management Module**: Implementation of essential risk control measures adhering to modern portfolio theory.
- **Visualization Suite**: Generation of insightful visualizations for model performance and backtesting results.
